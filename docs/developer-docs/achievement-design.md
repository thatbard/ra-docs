# Achievement Design

This is a guide on how to think about and design good achievement concepts. The core achievement set for a game should strive to utilize achievements of each of the major types listed here when possible: Progression, optional, collection, for-fun, and challenges.

## Progression Achievements

Progression achievements are awarded for required, unmissable game events. From acquiring a critical key item to clearing a required stage or witnessing a mandatory and important scene, these cover the base game experiences all players will encounter before reaching the end of a game. Progression achievements form the starting foundation we will build upon with other achievement types, but do not make a complete set on their own.

What makes a good progression achievement varies with game genre and mechanics. An arcade game may have achievements for completing individual stages or groups of stages depending on length. An RPG that doesn't have clearly defined stages may have a mix of achievements for acquiring key items, completing major story beats, and defeating bosses. In games with multiple difficulty settings or options, progression achievements should generally be allowed on any settings to engage players of any skill level that are interested in the game.

Finding the right amount of progression achievements is generally forgiving, but extremes should be avoided. Having achievements regularly popping every few minutes or for minor events feels trivial and undermines a sense of true accomplishment, but progressing for many hours without recognition can risk players not feeling engaged with the set.

#### Progression Examples

- [That Was Easy](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/9): Complete the first act of Green Hill Zone in [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://retroachievements.org/game/1)
- [Fighter](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/944): Obtain the Fighter's Sword and Shield in [The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past](https://retroachievements.org/game/355)
- [Red Pyramid Thing](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/261116): Survive your first confrontation with Red Pyramid Thing in [Silent Hill 2](https://retroachievements.org/game/1324)
- [Ok, Smarty, Go to a Party](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/583979): Complete Rounds 21-25 without quitting in [Bust-A-Move](https://retroachievements.org/game/16642)
- [Story of My Life](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/435956): Escape the island in [Resident Evil 4](https://retroachievements.org/game/2356)
- [League Champion](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/27615): Become the Pokémon League Champion in [Pokémon Emerald Version](https://retroachievements.org/game/668)
- [Camping with the Kongs](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/949): Complete every level in Vine Valley in [Donkey Kong Country](https://retroachievements.org/game/337)

#### Try to Avoid

- Individual achievements for a long series of short stages. Instead, consider achievements for completing groups of stages such as 1-5, or all stages around a certain theme.
- Achievements for simply starting a game or stage. These require no in-game effort and are easily exploitable by cheaters. For example, build around *completing* stage 1, not *entering* stage 2.
- Achievements for something that can be skipped or missed without the use of glitches, these belong in another category
- Having so many achievements that they feel trivial or like a play-by-play recap of what is happening.
- Having so few achievements that several hours of meaningful forward progress goes unrewarded.

## Sidequest/Optional Achievements

Vintage games, on their own, offer little-to-no incentive to beat a bonus mode, other than that it's something to do on a rainy day after you've beaten the game. Old games didn't have internet connectivity. And they had no social aspects other than 2-player mode, and maybe telling your friends at school that you beat something. But now, with RetroAchievements.org, we can display our vintage trophies (even though it requires us to redo what we've probably already done many years ago). These trophies are badges of honor. You can look at another member's Challenge Achievements and begin to understand how far they went, how skilled they are. Along with that comes respect from the other members. We socialize, we congratulate each other on a job well done. We feel like we belong, and we are in good company.

### Sidequests

There are often things the player can do that are confined to the rules of the game, but aren't necessary to complete it. In other words, a challenge built into the game by the original game developers. Usually they are fun, or sometimes not so fun, but deserve an award because they require hard work and persistence to achieve. You have to walk a fine tightrope between if dedicated players are likely to do something, vs. if the goal is stupid. People will have differing views over this, so steel yourself.

Often times, these types of achievements are even Easter Eggs or things the player never knew existed in their entire lives! Many players adore these types of achievements. I think it's because they learn something new about a game they grew up with, or feel like maybe they were the only ones who knew about a given secret and were excited to see it supported here. **It's important for us developers to REALLY know a game inside-and-out before creating an achievement set.**

**Examples of Sidequests:**

- Delivering tails to the Tail Collector in Final Fantasy IV.
- Finding the owner of the Insignificant Item in Earthbound.
- Giving the Jerky to the King in Guardia Castle.
- Anju sidequest in Majora's Mask.
- Learning about Wrex's past in Mass Effect.
- Diplomat/VIP escort missions in Flashback: The Quest for Identity.
- Discovering a secret room.

Sidequests are most often found in RPGs, but especially these days, sidequests are finding their way into just about every genre. Keep your eyes peeled - Even the unsuspecting platformer may have a sidequest or three. The Kirby series, for instance, has many hidden rooms and areas. Often times, sidequests end up awarding an item, which falls under a hybrid: Sidequest/Collection.

### Optional Achievements

**Examples of Optional Achievements:**

- Optional bosses.
- Clearing a challenge dungeon (which is a hybrid of Sidequest).
- Completing Expert Mode (which is a hybrid of Progression).
- Completing a secret challenge level.
- Getting an exceptionally rare drop off of a monster.
- Clearing the game with an optional character.
- Getting a high score.
- Completing features only unlocked on a second playthrough.
- Game modes that are only unlocked on multiple playthroughs.
- Optional game endings.
- Codes you can enter during the title screen to make the game harder.

This is the game makers hoping you'll like their game enough to keep coming back for more, even after those ending credits scroll by. They are trying to reward the player for completing their game, and create some form of satisfying re-playability. If the game makers went to the trouble making things like this an integral part of the game, we as achievement developers should recognize these challenges and create appropriate achievements for at least a few of them.

Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Star Ocean: The Second Story are famous for this. The Game Boy Advance Castlevania entries also do this. In fact, many games do this. If you aren't sure if your game has any extra modes or challenges, be sure to do some research and check out some FAQs. Or ask the community here, many of us are experts on the games supported here.

### Sidequest/Optional Pros and Cons

Sidequest/Optional Achievements make fantastic supplements to Progression Achievements.

#### Pros

- This is the bread-and-butter of achievement making. Chances are, a good deal of your achievements will come from this category. All games have optional things to do. Collect all the coins in a stage! Gain 9 lives! Creating achievements for this stuff is easy, and it rewards the player for their dedication.

- Game makers love appreciative players. They like it when players bother to dig deeper into their games, appreciating their hard work, otherwise we wouldn't see hidden 'fun' things in games like Easter Eggs, bonus scenes, etc. If game makers reward the players for doing it, why shouldn't we? Us devs should also recognize that the player has gone the extra mile.

- Game players love telling their friends when they find something unusual and off the beaten path in a game. With this site, they can show their friends that they did indeed slay the elusive 'yellow frog' rarely seen in the marsh, or found the warp to the 'mystery dimension'. If we include these curiosities in our achievement lists, we show the players that we are 'in the know', which builds confidence that we can competently guide them through the game.

- Sidequest/Optional Achievements give players something to strive for after they've beaten the game.

- These kinds of achievements can often be earned at any time and are not on a predictable schedule. Players feel an extra rush of endorphins when an achievement pops that they weren't expecting, but it was earned.

- These kinds of achievements are usually easy to code, second only to progression-style achievements.

#### Cons

- Some players don't care to explore beyond what a typical play-through has to offer, so a high percentage of these types of achievements in a game can leave a player under-rewarded. (Granted, this type of gamer is a bit of a rare bird on a website centered around achievements.)

- Some people may feel a specific challenge is too hard, even if it's something the original game developers included in-game for players to achieve.

- When you create a Sidequest/Optional Achievement for, say, running away from 999 battles (or other stat-maxing achievements), you risk that the people on this website may not feel this particular achievement offers a challenge and is just a 'grind-fest'. Achievements like this may very well end up getting demoted unless they serve a second purpose, like in Final Fantasy V where running away from battles actually powers up a weapon called the 'Chicken Knife'. This has SYNERGY with the game, as opposed to creating an achievement based upon raising a stat that has no other use.

## Collection Based Achievements

Most collection-based achievements are optional, unless the items themselves are MacGuffins, which in that case they would fall squarely under Progression/Collection.

**Examples:**

- Finding the Mickey hats hidden in the background to obtain 1-ups in Genesis Aladdin.
- Finding exceptionally well-hidden items.
- Bestiaries.
- Unlocking an optional character.
- Maxing out Money/kills/stats.
- Finding all the different ways to die in games like Prince of Persia or Shadowgate.
- Opening every treasure chest in a game/finding every powerup.
- All items/Collecting 99 or 255 (etc.) of an item.
- Catching them all in Pokemon (any monster collection, really.)

If the game keeps track of a stat, the game developer is practically daring you to max it out. Now you might be that kind of player, and you might not. You have to ask yourself, as a dev, whether or not other players are likely to get 9999 vampire bat kills, even if you wouldn't. The advantages to this are that people who wouldn't normally do this always have something to come back and work for when they feel like playing the game again. The disadvantage is that other players who wouldn't normally go that far and never would, but also feel like they have to MASTER every game quickly (a rare breed), will complain. If you get enough complaints, you might want to bring down that 9999 to something more reasonable, like 500. If no one's having fun with an achievement, it's not in the spirit of playing games or making achievements.

You have to use your better judgment here and think of what the player would enjoy the most. As a rule of thumb, it's better to have a few Sidequest/Optional Achievements than none at all. But with a little extra effort, these achievements can make your list very memorable.

Next, it's time to roll up our sleeves as devs and get REALLY creative when the devs themselves challenge the player beyond the rules of the game.

## For-Fun Achievements
Usually for fewer points than others, these are typically "Easter egg" type achievements. These involve letting fun scenes not typically seen by players to happen, interacting with backgrounds/objects, finding secret cameos, and so on. These are usually done with purpose: to make the game entertaining. And we as developers should make every attempt possible to recognize and support these as much as we can.

This can be especially true for hacks of games, where hack makers will typically insert fun curiosities not found in the original.

**Examples of For-Fun:**
- [The Fourth Day (RIP)](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/55560): Let the Moon crash in  [The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask](https://retroachievements.org/game/10679)
- [Scratch Beneath the Surface](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/27747): Hang off a ledge and take care of an itch in [Earthworm Jim](https://retroachievements.org/game/889)
- [Dangling Corpse](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/18317): Stage 1 - Knock this poor guy around a bit in [Castlevania: Bloodlines](https://retroachievements.org/game/69)
- [Ratatouille](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/161551): Microwave the hamster in [Maniac Mansion](https://retroachievements.org/game/16360)

## Challenges
One thing every developer should keep in mind about retro gamers is that most of us have played the games we play many times before, and we often look for new ways of revisiting our favorite titles. Some of us can clear Contra without losing a single life. Challenge achievements are opportunities to prove it!

Think about it: before RetroAchievements, about the only way to prove you can complete a flawless run of Contra was to invite a friend over and show them or figure out recording software and upload a video. But even then, word-of-mouth is only provable to a few people at most, and videos can be easily doctored to look flawless. RetroAchievements, however, has Hardcore mode which helps to provide proof of accomplishment and mitigate cheating.

You will have Progression Achievements, and you may have Sidequest/Optional Achievements, but if you want to create an achievement list that's truly great and stands out, you need at least a few Challenge Achievements! Think back to all the games you've played. What are some of the most memorable achievements? They were probably Challenge Achievements. There may be exceptions to the rule (many players will fondly remember beating a game they'd never played before), but the typical player isn't going to fondly recall "Cleared Stage X," they are going to remember challenges that made their playthrough unique, such as--

- defeating a boss under some limitations
- completing a stage faster than previously expected
- beating the game with specific party setups

Even critics of some Challenge Achievements will be in favor of others, and this is why a good achievement developer will consider diving deeply into the game's mechanics and creating unique and/or unusual challenges.

However, the developer should take caution: Challenge Achievements offer a unique game experience, but samey achievements that can be found in other ports or are used ad nauseum over a single set can feel cumbersome for players. Many players who play some games in a franchise (e.g. Zelda or Mega Man) will often play the entire series, and while some Challenge Achievement types make sense for some franchises (damageless boss fights in Mega Man games), they can create a sense of fatigue. A good developer will find the balance between "tough" and "tiresome," but this may require deeper digging into the memory to find the memory needed for more interesting challenges.

### Speedrun Challenges
blah

### Limitation Challenges
blah

### Score Challenges
blah

### Challenge Pros and Cons
Challenge achievements are your chance to show players how to play their favorite games in unique ways, but as previously stated, you want to be careful of inducing fatigue. It is sometimes acceptable (though not encouraged) to tolerate a few grievances of challenge types in a game, but if a significant amount of comments are complaints, the developer may wish to reconsider either how many Challenge Achievements there are, what type they are, or both.

### Pros
- Many players love these and will provide constructive feedback on the more unique ones
- Leaderboards will often satisfy the very hardcore players without upsetting the more casual players (who may still be looking for official Hardcore experiences)
- Creativity can not only let your achievement set stand out, but you can also improve your skills at finding the harder-to-find memory beyond "lives" and "stage"

### Cons
- The juice may not be worth the squeeze, and developers can spend a long time finding and testing necessary memory for overly specific challenges
- Set instability may occur if it is later determined that dynamic memory (via pointers) was used unaware
- Players are more willing to be vocal about challenges they disagree with
